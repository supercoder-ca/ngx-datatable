# ngx-datatable

`ngx-datatable` is an Angular component for presenting large and complex data.  It has all the features you would expect from any other table but in a light package with _no external dependencies_. The table was designed to be extremely flexible and light; it doesn't make any assumptions about your data or how you: filter, sort or page it.

Check out the [documentation](https://swimlane.gitbooks.io/ngx-datatable/) & [demos](http://swimlane.github.io/ngx-datatable/) for more information!
